<p>The Cold War variant is set just two years before the Cuban Missle Crisis, and explores the potential conflict between the world's two great superpowers at that time, NATO and the USSR. First and foremost, however, Cold War is a one on one variant designed to be as entertaining and as balanced as possible. Please note that to that end, a few small liberties have been taken to improve gameplay, such as the historically inaccurate border between Eastern Germany and Denmark.</p>

<p><b>General Notes:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>The supply centers Toronto, Alaska, Iran, and Japan were historically allied with NATO. However, to improve the balance of the map, they start off the game neutral.</li>
<li>There are two cases in which bordering islands can be traversed by armies: Indonesia<=>Phillipines, and Indonesia<=>Australia. West Canada does not border Greenland.</li>
<li>Panama and Egypt contain "canals," meaning that fleets can traverse them as if they only had a single coast. They are analagous to Kiel in Classic Diplomacy.</li>
<li>Because of the lack of a Skagerrak territory, North Sea borders Sweden. Knowledge of this border is key for the first few moves of any game.</li>
<li>Due to the compactness of many territories, please consult the large map if you are confused or need a closer look. Coast markers are also included on the large map.</li>
